<p>Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano. As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.</p>

<p>Git is free and open-source software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2. Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p>

  <dt><h3><strong>1. Strong support for non-linear development</strong></h3></dt>
  <dd><h4>- Git supports rapid branching and merging, and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history.</h4></dd>
  <dt><h3><strong>2. Distributed Development</strong></h3></dt>
  <dd><h4>- Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history, and changes are copied from one such repository to another.</h4></dd>
  <dt><h3><strong>3. Compatibility with existent systems and protocols</strong></h3></dt>
  <dd><h4>-Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of existent CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories.</h4></dd>
  <dt><h3><strong>4. Efficient handlings of large projects</strong></h3></dt>
  <dd><h4>-Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable, and performance tests done by Mozilla showed that it was an order of magnitude.</h4></dd>
  <dt><h3><strong>5. Toolkit-based design</strong></h3></dt>
  <dd><h4>-Git was designed as a set of programs written in C and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.</h4></dd>
